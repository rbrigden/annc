## Assignment

 Programfeedforward,backprop,andstochasticgradientdescentwith
minibatches in Cython.


Choose at least one of the tutorial datasets
Experiment with at least three of the following

Sigmoid vs ReLU


• Cost functions
• Number of nodes
• Number of layers
• Learning rate
• Regularization parameter
• Size of minibatch
• Momentum
• Adagrad, AdaDelta, RMSprop, ADAM

Do multiple random initializations and/or multiple cross- validations. Compare.
Report the change in program running time as key routines are implemented in C.
The best and most interesting will be selected for presentation in class.
Post on Piazza or other site set up by Infra team.

If your problem requires CNN or RNN/LSTM, choose from the additional relevant hyperparameters.
  Post interim reports by noon each Wednesday. Final report due Feb 27.
Learn from your mistakes.
